   - SemVer(Semantic Versioning )

       ```json
       {"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"}
       ```

     The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that wonâ€™t work with earlier versions.

   - tilde (~) character : Allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version

       ```

   - caret (^) character : Allow an npm dependency to update to the latest MINOR version

       ```json
       {"package": "^MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"}
       ```
